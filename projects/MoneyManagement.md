summary: "How I managed my finances as a young college student."
---



Since the start of College I was thrown in the deep end with a bunch of bills and debt. To deal with this I learned how to manage my finances using google sheets and was able to use the lessons from that to help make sheets for my friends.

------

In the beginning it was really stressful because I had never worked with google sheets or excel before but from trial and error as well as tutorials online I got more comfortable. I learned how to use sheets to track my monthly purchases, my credit card balances, and my upcoming purchases. From this I learned how to better set up charts, tables, and graphs as well as using different functions inside sheets.
