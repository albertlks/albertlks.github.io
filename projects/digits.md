At the start of the second semester we were assigned to follow along with a sample project to learn how to make nextjs applications. Below is the repo to check it out!

During the creation of this tutorial project we learned more about bootstrap and how to quickly and efficiently expand upon our basics. We got introduced to Nextjs in depth and learned to make a website that interacts with a database and takes advantage of both User side and Admin side account.
