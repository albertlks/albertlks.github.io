## My Path


  From the start similarly to most people in this course and whole degree path I have been playing with computers for as long as I can remember. Whether it was hogging the computer from my brother or begging my parents for my own PC, I have always loved computers. Even though I had this passion for computers I never knew how I could pursue something like that but also in a way where I could work alongside others and with my community. In highschool the only computer related course(s) I could take were in cyber security which I enjoyed but I wanted something more hands on, something where I could build and assist the people around me who work so hard to help me. Thats when I discovered coding.

  In the summer before college I learned more about programming and tried some online courses and found that it was really fun and challenging in a way that felt exciting. Thats when I realized that the career I wanted to pursue was being a software engineer, being able to work with others to solve problems and help build things to help my community through coding sounds really exciting. In the near future as a big step towards doing that I would like to build a website that operates as an appointment site that can be used in testing centers. The one we use at my job has times where it stops working, or bugs come about and leaves us having to do everything by hand. The concept of being able to build something to fix this issue and to help not only myself, my coworkers, but also those around me makes me happy. Helping the community and the world around is what it means to be a software engineer and thats why I want to pursue it.
