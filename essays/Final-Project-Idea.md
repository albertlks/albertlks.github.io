<H1>Overview</H1>

_The Problem:_ The UH Gym is very popular but I am sure it would be more popular if working out was more accesible
and experienced lifters could encourage those who are not as experienced

_The Solution:_ The Local Lifters app allows new lifters to create a profile with their goals in fitness and the application would filter through  the
workouts submitted by other members and new lifters would be shown workouts from other lifters with similar goals.

<H1>Approach</H1>

Once a student creates a profile with their email, they are prompted to choose their goal based off of general categories for example sport, powerlifting, bodybuilding, crossfit, etc. After that they are shown workouts submitted by other users tagged with the goal they chose in mind. People with sport goals will see workouts done by people who train with sports in mind. Additionally it would be possible for newer lifters to reach out to the people who submitted there workouts with questions, advice, and more.

<H1>Use Case Ideas</H1>

New user goes to landing page, logs in, sets up there goal, answers if they are a new or seasoned lifter, if they are unsure there would be an AI assistant to help them choose their goal and they can choose multiple if they have multiple. After that they go to the home page which shows all the different workouts submitted which will have tags to them for additional filter purpse (Athletic leg day or Powerlifting Push day). If they are a seasoned lifter they could see the option to post workouts as well and to tag them with what they are.

Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.

<H1>Beyond the Basics</H1>

New lifters can eventually become seasoned lifters with the option to post their workouts. The AI assistant would also be beyond the basics. A section for meetups with those willing to train people. A comment section under submitted workouts for people to talk about them and their experience with them.
