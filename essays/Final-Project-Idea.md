_The Problem:_ The UH Gym is very popular but I am sure it would be more popular if working out was more accesible
and experienced lifters could encourage those who are not as experienced

_The Solution:_ The Local Lifters app allows new lifters to create a profile with their goals in fitness and the application would filter through  the
workouts submitted by other members and new lifters would be shown workouts from other lifters with similar goals.
