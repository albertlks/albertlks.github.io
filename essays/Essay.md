## My First Experience With Typescript

Prior to ICS 314 I had worked with the standard beginner languages that most people learn with. Java, C/C++ and a little Python but none of them really grasped me like Javascript and Typescript did. I feel like things were just easier to transfer from idea to code and maybe it is because we have not done any advanced programming yet, but I feel like this language was the most fun and easiest to pick up so far. I enjoyed it so much that outside of the required homework of working with typescript on freecodecamp I did extra lessons and more activities because it is really enjoyable. After doing the ES6 lesson it really hammered down how great this language is because of the many things you can do while looking neat and clean at the same time.

## Coding like an Athlete!


On top of the standard lessons we had to do with typescript we had to do the WODs on top of them. During the WODs I feel like I speak for everyone who has done them but I was pretty stressed. This stress felt different than the stress from a normal assignment or quiz though because if I did not understand how to get the solution I really wanted to know and was eager to. The cycle of trying, failing, learning and then trying again trying to crunch the time down more and more with each attempt is addicting and very enjoyable.


## For the Future.

I am a little worried that things may get a lot harder from now in a way where I can not keep up and get left behind but with the new approach I think I will not give up.
