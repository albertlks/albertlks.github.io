## My First Experience With HTML
When I first started coding in HTML I was excited to learn something that as I code and build I can see the changes in real time on a webpage. 
HTML is tricky in the sense that it is very simple at first, typing out on a website "Hello World" is arguably easier than it has been before in other languages up to this point. 
From there on I can say it certainly gets more difficult given all the different things you can do and are asked to do. Below is a picture of one of the first sites I built using HTML.

<img width="500px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src ="../img/NoBootstrapBrowsHist.png">
After learning more about it I was finding certain things hard to do especially in regards to formatting and making things look clean and that's when Bootstrap 5 came to save the day.
